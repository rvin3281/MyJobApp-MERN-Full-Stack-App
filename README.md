# MyJobApp: Personal Full-Stack MERN Development - Frontend and Backend App

- The primary objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive Job Management System that enables registered users with different access roles to efficiently manage job-related information. The system was designed to facilitate the following key functionalities:

- User Empowerment: Users with standard access roles could Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) job records, empowering them to manage their job applications effectively.

- Administrative Oversight: Administrators held the authority to oversee and manage all job applications created by users. This included the ability to perform CRUD operations, ensuring centralized control and oversight.

- Statistical Insights: Administrators had access to statistical features, providing valuable insights into job application trends, performance metrics, and other relevant data points.

- Secured Access: The system incorporated a robust security framework with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication and authorization patterns. This ensured that only authenticated users, whether standard or administrators, could access the application.

## Technical Skills

- Full-Stack Development: Leveraged a full-stack development approach, integrating both front-end and back-end components to create a seamless user experience.

- React and Redux Toolkit: Utilized React18 for building the dynamic user interface and efficiently managed global state using Redux Toolkit.

- Node.js and Express: Created a server application from scratch using Node.js and Express, allowing for robust back-end functionality.

- Database Management: Employed MongoDB Atlas to set up a cloud-based MongoDB database, providing a scalable and reliable data storage solution.

- API Development: Developed a RESTful API with comprehensive testing using Thunder Client to ensure reliable data communication between the front end and back end.

- Security Implementation: Implemented stringent security measures, including password hashing and JWT authentication, to safeguard user data and protect against unauthorized access.

- Routing and Navigation:Set up routing and navigation using React Router 6.4+ for a seamless user experience.
  Implemented nested pages and protected routes for user access control.
